Here's a clear explanation of liveness violations caused by deadlock, with both a real-world analogy and a conceptual code example:

### 1. Real-World Example: **Traffic Gridlock at Intersection**
**Scenario**:  
A 4-way intersection has traffic lights that malfunction, causing all lanes to simultaneously get green lights. Cars from all four directions enter the intersection at the same time and block each other.

**Deadlock Formation**:
- North-bound cars block East-bound cars
- East-bound cars block South-bound cars
- South-bound cars block West-bound cars
- West-bound cars block North-bound cars

**Liveness Violation**:  
No vehicle can move forward (progress) because each is waiting for space held by another. Traffic flow completely stops despite all cars being "ready to move" – a classic liveness failure.

**Why it's a Deadlock**:  
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Road space is occupied
- **Hold and Wait**: Drivers hold their position while waiting for others to move
- **No Preemption**: Cars can't be forcibly removed
- **Circular Wait**: North → East → South → West → North dependency cycle

### 2. Conceptual Code Example: **Bank Account Transfer Deadlock**
```java
class Account {
    private int balance;
    
    void transfer(Account to, int amount) {
        // Acquire lock for sender
        synchronized(this) {          // Lock1 acquired
            // Acquire lock for receiver
            synchronized(to) {       // Lock2 acquired
                this.balance -= amount;
                to.balance += amount;
            }
        }
    }
}

// Thread 1
new Thread(() -> 
    accountA.transfer(accountB, 100) // Locks A then B
).start();

// Thread 2
new Thread(() -> 
    accountB.transfer(accountA, 50)  // Locks B then A
).start();
```

**Deadlock Scenario**:
1. Thread 1 locks Account A, then tries to lock B
2. Thread 2 locks Account B, then tries to lock A
3. Both threads wait indefinitely for the other's lock

**Liveness Violation Manifestation**:  
- Threads block permanently
- Transfers never complete
- Program hangs despite CPU availability
- No progress in application state

**Deadlock Conditions Met**:  
| Condition          | Manifestation                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Mutual Exclusion   | `synchronized` locks                   |
| Hold and Wait      | Threads hold 1 lock while waiting      |
| No Preemption      | OS won't force lock release            |
| Circular Wait      | Thread1: A→B, Thread2: B→A             |

### Key Characteristics of Deadlock-Induced Liveness Failure:
1. **Starvation of Progress**: Resources exist but remain unusable
2. **Indefinite Postponement**: Operations never complete
3. **Non-Obvious Triggers**: May occur only under specific timing conditions
4. **System-Wide Impact**: Often cascades to freeze entire systems

**Resolution Strategies**:
- **Real-world**: Traffic police intervention (external preemption)
- **Code**: Enforce lock ordering (e.g., lock smaller account ID first)
- **System Design**: Timeouts, deadlock detection algorithms

Deadlocks violate liveness because the system loses its ability to make forward progress despite having all necessary resources and active participants – essentially "frozen in time" while appearing operationally ready.

Here's a C implementation that fixes the deadlock using lock ordering with unique account IDs:

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    int balance;
    pthread_mutex_t lock;
    long id;  // Unique ID for ordering
} Account;

// Create account with initial balance and ID
Account* create_account(int initial_balance, long id) {
    Account* acc = malloc(sizeof(Account));
    acc->balance = initial_balance;
    acc->id = id;
    pthread_mutex_init(&acc->lock, NULL);
    return acc;
}

// Transfer money between accounts (deadlock-free)
void transfer(Account* from, Account* to, int amount) {
    // Determine locking order based on ID
    Account* first = from;
    Account* second = to;
    if (from->id > to->id) {
        first = to;
        second = from;
    }

    // Lock in consistent order
    pthread_mutex_lock(&first->lock);
    pthread_mutex_lock(&second->lock);
    
    // Perform transfer
    if (from->balance >= amount) {
        from->balance -= amount;
        to->balance += amount;
        printf("Transferred $%d from %ld to %ld\n", amount, from->id, to->id);
    } else {
        printf("Insufficient funds in %ld\n", from->id);
    }
    
    // Unlock in reverse order
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&second->lock);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&first->lock);
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    Account* acc1 = create_account(1000, 1);
    Account* acc2 = create_account(1000, 2);
    
    // Transfer from acc1 to acc2
    transfer(acc1, acc2, 500);
    
    // Transfer from acc2 to acc1
    transfer(acc2, acc1, 200);
    
    printf("Final balances:\n");
    printf("Account %ld: $%d\n", acc1->id, acc1->balance);
    printf("Account %ld: $%d\n", acc2->id, acc2->balance);
    
    // Cleanup
    pthread_mutex_destroy(&acc1->lock);
    pthread_mutex_destroy(&acc2->lock);
    free(acc1);
    free(acc2);
    
    return 0;
}
```

Key deadlock prevention techniques used:

1. **Lock Ordering**:
   - Accounts are always locked in ascending ID order
   - Breaks circular wait condition
   - Ensures consistent locking sequence globally

2. **Consistent Lock Acquisition**:
   ```c
   if (from->id > to->id) {
       first = to;
       second = from;
   }
   ```
   This guarantees the lock with smaller ID is always acquired first

3. **Safe Unlocking**:
   ```c
   pthread_mutex_unlock(&second->lock);
   pthread_mutex_unlock(&first->lock);
   ```
   Unlocks in reverse order (though unlock order doesn't cause deadlocks)

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Actual production code should check mutex lock/unlock return values
   - Addressed here with simple print statements for clarity
